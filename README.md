# HYDIV Landing Page (Chakra UI)

## :wave: Hello there!

This is a simple landing page made using the [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) library mostly for testing and learning some of its features.

The live preview of the website can be viewed [here.](https://hydiv-homepage.netlify.app/)

Most of the design layouts are made for desktop and tablet view, so viewing it on mobile devices may not provide the best experience.

Some of the icons used in here are imported from the [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) library.
